                <p><b>Haruki Kitahara</b></p>
                <p>
                    The protagonist of White Album 2. 
                    He is a third year student at Hōjō High School 
                    and a member of the light music club and has excellent grades. 
                    He dates and loves Setsuna, but eventually Kazusa Touma shows her 
                    true feelings for him, and Haruki reveals that he loves her too.
                     Haruki plays second guitar. A student with excellent 
                     grades, who's meddlesome and preachy. Lately he's been 
                     concentrating on practicing the guitar for 
                    the school festival, but he's not talented enough to go on stage.

                <p><b>Setsuna Ogiso</b></p>
                <p>
                    Setsuna Ogiso is the first main heroine. 
                    She is the triggering of the plot and the only 
                    character with an important role in all the routes, 
                    even more than Haruki himself. Setsuna is a third year 
                    student at Hōjō High School and has been Miss Hōjō two 
                    years in a row and enjoys singing karaoke. She is beautiful 
                    and friendly when approached, yet places a wall between herself 
                    and others so she has no close friends. She refrains from making friends 
                    due to her troubled past during her years in middle school. However, 
                    she is this way precisely because she was consecutively voted as the 
                    prettiest girl in the school, 
                    and her classmates all expect her to be a fashionable, wealthy young lady.

                <p>
                    Kazusa Touma is the second main heroine. 
                    She is a third year student at Hōjō and is in the 
                    same class as Haruki. She often dozes off in, is late for, 
                    and skips class. She is a very talented pianist, and comes 
                    from a wealthy family. Kazusa is the daughter of a famous 
                    pianist, and a musical genius who dropped out of Hōjō's music 
                    division. She is particularly annoyed with Haruki, who has 
                    been persistently pestering her for the past half year. 
                    However, once Haruki befriends her, she is a valuable ally 
                    for the cultural festival. When it comes to music, her 
                    passion and confidence is unrivaled.
